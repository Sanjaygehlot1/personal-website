You are probably using Linux already like your servers, containers, cloud VMs, even Android. Once you understand the basics, working in DevOps or backend feels way easier.

This is not theory heavy. Just the stuff you actually use daily.

## What Linux Really Is

Linux is a **kernel**, not a full OS. Distros like Ubuntu, Debian, or Arch just bundle tools around it.

When you SSH into a server, you’re basically talking to the kernel through a shell. No fancy UI, just commands doing real work.

---

## Filesystem Basics

Everything in Linux is treated like a file (logs, devices, processes, configs).

```
/
├── bin
├── etc
├── home
├── var
├── usr
├── proc
├── dev
```

Unlike Windows drives, Linux has one single tree. External disks just mount somewhere inside it.

## Terminal Commands I Actually Use

### Navigation

```bash
pwd
ls -lah
cd /etc
cd ~
cd -
```

### File Operations

```bash
touch file.txt
mkdir -p projects/linux
cp -r src/ backup/
mv old.txt new.txt
rm -rf dist/
```

### Viewing Logs

```bash
cat file.log
head -20 file.log
tail -f file.log
```

---

## Permissions (Quick Understanding)

```bash
-rwxr-xr-- file.sh
```

* Owner → rwx
* Group → r-x
* Others → r--

Commands you’ll use a lot:

```bash
chmod +x deploy.sh
chmod 644 config.yml
chown user:group folder/
```

---

## Processes & Monitoring

```bash
ps aux
top
pgrep nginx
kill 1234
pkill nginx
```

If something breaks in production, these commands become your best friends.

---

## Package Management (Install Stuff Fast)

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nginx
```

Different distros = different managers, but concept stays same.

---

## systemd Services

```bash
sudo systemctl start nginx
sudo systemctl restart nginx
sudo systemctl status nginx
journalctl -u nginx -f
```

Basically how servers stay alive after reboot.

---

## Pipes = Linux Superpower

```bash
grep "ERROR" app.log | wc -l
awk '{print $1}' access.log | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head
```

Small commands + pipes = insane power.

---

## SSH (Daily DevOps Tool)

```bash
ssh user@server
ssh -i key.pem user@ip
ssh -L 3000:localhost:3000 user@ip
```

Once key auth is setup, password login feels ancient.

---

## Simple Bash Script Example

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e

echo "Starting deploy..."
git pull origin main
npm ci --omit=dev
npm run build
sudo systemctl restart myapp
```

Automation is where Linux really starts paying off.

---

## Tools Worth Knowing

* grep → search logs
* sed → replace text
* awk → process columns
* curl → test APIs
* jq → parse JSON

---

Linux is basically the backbone of modern infra. The more comfortable you get with the terminal, the less you depend on GUIs — and honestly, things start breaking less too.
