export const About = `
I'm an Information Technology undergraduate (ACE'27) passionate about building scalable digital products. My work blends full-stack development with cloud and DevOps practices. I enjoy turning real ideas into systems that actually ship.

Currently working as an AWS DevOps Intern, I focus on designing CI/CD pipelines and automating infrastructure using Terraform. I build cloud-native workflows that improve developer productivity and deployment reliability. Alongside this, I develop full-stack applications with a strong focus on clean architecture and performance. I continuously explore modern engineering practices to stay ahead of evolving tech stacks.

Beyond tools and frameworks, I care about building meaningful, maintainable solutions.
My goal is to grow into an engineer who designs systems that scale and last.
